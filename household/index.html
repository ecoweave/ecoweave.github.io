  <h1>Household</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    I take empty and unloved crisp packets and upcycle them to create wonderfully 
    functional products. Wrappers that would otherwise end up as landfill are 
    lovingly woven into unique designs that are useful, hard wearing and eye 
    catching. All of my products are made with common UK packets, can you 
    spot them all?
